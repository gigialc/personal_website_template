                <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  AutoTask analyzes the daily activity on your computer and offers to automate repetitive and boring tasks using AI agents.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  Are there tasks that you know you need to do but dread having to do them? Applying for jobs, shopping for groceries, paying your bills, travel arrangements, booking appointments, organizing your digital photos, etc.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  What if AI could take over some of those tasks, and do them on your behalf? That's where AutoTask comes in - it watches what you're doing throughout the day, and sees which tasks you're repeatedly doing, and comes up with a plan for automating those tasks.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  These tasks come into the AutoTask dashboard where you can review the plan before accepting the task. Once you accept the task, AutoTask gets to work - firing up a browser and executing the plan to complete the task. When it's done with the task, it reports back what it did in the dashboard.

              <p className="text-white/80 mb-4">AutoTask is comprised of 3 key components:</p>
              
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-white mb-2">1. Screenpipe</h3>
                  <p className="text-white/80">
                    For capturing screen activity and OCRing it (it can also record audio and transcribe it). We've built a custom pipe called tasks-auto-complete that captures the OCR output from Screenpipe, passes it to OpenAI which then returns suggestions on how to automate the activity.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>

                  <p className="text-white/80">
                    The Electron app listens for tasks suggested by the tasks-auto-complete pipe and displays them in the dashboard. It's the "glue code" that takes the tasks from the pipe and passes them along to browser use for execution. It also has a MacOS notification capability to alert you when it's identified a task to be automated.
                  </p>

                <div>

                  <p className="text-white/80">
                    For using AI to execute tasks in the browser. Browser use has a whole library of tasks that it can automate including grocery shopping!
